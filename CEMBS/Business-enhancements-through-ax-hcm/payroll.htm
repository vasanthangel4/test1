                It is the responsibility of each and every organization to manage and motivate their
                employees by providing them better wages and compensation as per the industry standards.
                Indeed, administrating salary including calculation of tax deductions, the retirement
                benefits and disbursements of salaries are considered to be the backbone of employees’
                operational and satisfaction focus.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                However, managing the payroll process is a bit complicated and challenging. It requires
                extensive skill-sets and knowledge in several areas including human resource, finance
                and other related departments. Although organizations do not derive competitive
                advantage from payroll activities, the function is still critical in carrying out
                business operations. Lack of Payroll management significantly reduces employee morale
                and productivity. It is therefore most important that the salaries are paid on time,
                without the involvement of excessive resources in the process. Establishing a well-run
                payroll function is not an easy task. Listed are few key challenges faced by payroll
                management:</p>
            <ul class="ul_reasons">
                <li>Not enough details are reflected in the pay slip</li>
                <li>Excessive overtime and excessive payroll staff</li>
                <li>Repetitive trivial activities like timekeeping, Journal Entry Preparation and distributing
                    pay slips</li>
                <li>No database of payroll history for the previous years</li>
                <li>Payroll Software revisions or report revisions are slow and turnover of MIS/IT is
                    also high</li>
                <li>Manual Payroll is not reflected in the payroll system</li>
                <li>Last pay computation of resigned employees and their 13th month pay is not computed
                    automatically</li>
                <li>No report that accounts for changes/variances in the current payroll versus the
                    past period's payroll to make it easy for the company to verify and check the payroll
                    registers</li>
                <li>No automated facility to handle varying pay rules, multi-company, payroll in foreign
                    currency and payroll for fixed tax non-employees like consultants</li>
                <li>Non-online, single site timekeeping system </li>
            </ul>
