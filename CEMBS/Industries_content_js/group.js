document.write("<p>CEM helps Group Companies through both centralized and de-centralized deployments. Its distinct Microsoft Dynamics ERP solutions help clients work with one partner to manage the whole deployment as a single organization or as a syndicate of local partners. A group company project requires local support in multiple locations; the options are working with a large partner who has a presence in all the locations required, or to work with a partner who can assist in putting together a syndicate of appropriate partners. CEM has offices in 8 international locations and offers flexible options for successfully implementing and supporting Dynamics across the globe, whether this is a centrally managed implementation, controlling local installations or multiple installations managed locally with varying levels of autonomy.<\/p>");
