document.write("<p>Over the past 10 years, CEM has worked exclusively in the Microsoft Dynamics space. By implementing complex ERP systems with SL, GP, NAV, CRM and AX, CEM has successfully implemented systems in 19 vertical industries. Since no two industries and no two organizations are alike, each implementation poses a unique set of challenges. PROCESS is always the key. Starting with Microsoft's \"Sure Step\" process, CEM adds several additional layers of feedback with stakeholders during the implementation process. This accomplishes several things. First it constantly manages expectations. Second it provides a forward-looking dimension to custom tailoring the solution to a unique set of criteria. This \"custom tailoring\" usually comes in the form of software code, or more specifically Intellectual Property (IP).<\/p>");
document.write("<p><strong>IP is the key to making any ERP platform perform optimally for any given vertical industry or organization<\/strong>. Many of the Microsoft Dynamics ERP platforms have built-in IP to handle a variety of industry-specific issues. But over the years, many of CEM's customers have demanded more.<\/p>");
document.write("<p><strong>CEM's IP development has provided the engine for creating industry-specific ERP solutions<\/strong>. Today, CEM employs approximately 90 highly trained IP developers, whose sole purpose is to create modules that optimize Microsoft Dynamics solutions for specific applications. Sometimes the applications are big, and cover an entire industry &ndash; like CEM AX Construct. Sometimes they provide horizontal solutions across several industries &ndash; like CEM AX HCM and CEM AX Payroll. And then there are the hundreds of smaller modules, that when put together provide just the right solution for every single implementation.</p>");
