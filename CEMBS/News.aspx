                CEM Business Solutions on a success mission in Qatar
            </h2>
            <p>
                Just one year after being launched in the Qatar market, CEM has managed to complete
                three successful implementations and is now gearing up to complete a few more. The
                recently completed implementations were for QSL (Qatar Star League), ITC (International
                Tire Centre) and Q-tires.</p>
            <p>
                CEM implemented the AX 2012 system at the ITC, a distributor of Good Year and Falcon
                tires for Qatar and Bahrain, with the intention of improving their inventory and
                supply chain management. The system proved to be immensely useful in streamlining
                and controlling their inventory services while also drastically improving their
                supply chain management systems.</p>
            <p>
                Also, CEM successfully implemented the AX 2012 retail system at Q-tires, the retail
                arm of the ITC, to provide a wider and more accessible channel for sales while also
                acquiring detailed demographic information which helped in mammoth business growth.</p>
            <p>
                CEM was also instrumental in providing ERP services to the Qatar Star league which
                is a leading all-star football league in the country. After carefully analyzing
                the need of the hour, CEM successfully implemented the CEM HCM and CfMD certified
                CEM AX Payroll for the QSL. This system proved to be an incomparable when it came
                to workforce management. The system provided easy solutions to capturing player
                attendance while holding up-to-date data on their fitness and performances. Also,
                the payroll process for regular employees and professional players were simplified.
                The system’s interface with ZAM time and attendance system proved to avoid attendance
                redundancy.</p>
            <p>
                With three such amazing and successful implementations in Qatar, CEM is fast
                growing to be one of the most sought after IT solutions companies known
                for their service attitude and timely consultations and implementations. Also, these
                success stories have CEM raging for more.</p>

            <p>
                A decade of unbelievable laurels, innovation, collaboration, and amazing discoveries…
            </p>
            <p>
                Two keywords that flash into our mind when thinking about CEM are diligence and
                consistency! Having carved out a special place for itself in this competitive software
                sphere, CEM on Dec 25, 2013 celebrated tenth year of its establishment at Dubai
                office with great vigour and heartiness. Theme dressed in &ldquo;red&rdquo;, the
                entire CEM family indirectly implied that their &ldquo;<strong>Developments&nbsp;will
                    never&nbsp;stop!&rdquo; </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                It was great to see all happy faces dancing until their feet fell off with the multitude
                of games organized! Inculcating teamwork was the &ldquo;collage work&rdquo; with
                the simple papers - the split up three teams went ahead in depicting CEM&rsquo;s
                global reach over the span of ten years innovatively… Reeling over the yesteryears&rsquo;
                fun were games including, musical chair and lemon the spoon!<strong> Here are the pictures
                    from this high-spirited event…</strong></p>

                CEM AX Payroll is now Certified for Microsoft Dynamics (CfMD), which signifies that
                the solution has met Microsoft Corp.’s highest standard for partner-developed software
                by successfully meeting all certification requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Solutions that are certified for Microsoft Dynamics have demonstrated development
                quality and compatibility with the Microsoft Dynamics product on which they run
                by passing rigorous software testing for Microsoft Dynamics performed by VeriTest
                (a service of Lion Bridge). In addition, the Microsoft Dynamics partner must have
                customers who are successfully using the certified solution and are willing to recommend
                it and be a Gold Certified Partner in the Microsoft Partner Program.</p>

                <strong>SharePoint as an ECM solution: Forester rates Microsoft a &ldquo;Strong Performer&rdquo;:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Forrester's latest assessment of Enterprise Content Management (ECM) vendors paints
                a picture of a rapidly changing landscape that's being driven both by vendor innovations
                and user needs. &quot;ECM project justifications have changed over the past six
                years from focusing on compliance to improving productivity,&quot; reports Forrester
                in <em>The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Content Management Suites, Q3 2013</em>. &quot;Organizations
                want better ways for their employees to derive value from content and increase the
                flexibility in the work environment.&quot;</p>
            <p>
                As part of its quarterly look at ECM suites, Forrester used 48 criteria to evaluate
                13 different offerings, including Microsoft's SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint Online.
                For the current offerings evaluated, the key areas of content management assessed
                broke down into business, transactional, and foundational content.

                <strong>Document storage attachments from Dynamics AX within SharePoint:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                With the R2 release of Dynamics AX 2012, a new feature was quietly snuck into the
                product that allows you to store document attachments from Dynamics AX within SharePoint
                rather than within an archive location, or within the database. This opens up a
                whole slew of possibilities when it comes to document management within SharePoint.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>As CRM 2013 release nears, Microsoft Dynamics partners talk of CRM Online readiness:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 may deliver big improvements in a range of areas<strong>,</strong>
                but the scope of its changes is significant. Preparing for those changes in a short
                term, is especially critical for CRM Online customers who will only have a limited
                time frame within which to schedule their upgrades. Current CRM Online customers
                (not those in the TAP program) will begin getting scheduled upgrades as early as
                October.</p>

                <strong>Microsoft Dynamics C5 2014 release planned, based on the Dynamics NAV core:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft Dynamics C5 is probably one of the most popular Dynamics ERP systems.
                It is largely the basic ERP system for most of the small companies in Denmark.

                <strong>Microsoft announced that it will deliver three significant Dynamics application
                    upgrades this month: Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Dynamics GP 2013 and the December update
                    of Dynamics CRM Online:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest news with Dynamics AX 2012 R2 is that Microsoft's most scalable ERP
                system can now support multiple languages, multiple national tax and compliance
                regimes, and multiple vertical-industry capabilities on a single-instance deployment.
                AX 2012 R2 upgrade also enhances embedded, role-based business intelligence. AX
                already supported role-based business intelligence (BI), but with R2 support for
                Microsoft SQL Server 2012, AX takes advantage of new Power View in-memory data-visualization
                technology. The upgrade delivers rich data and animated data visualizations that
                reveal trends, according to Microsoft.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Dynamics GP 2013 Release:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Dynamics GP 2013 will be released on December 19, and the big theme is Web and cloud
                deployment by way of a new Web client and a new Web management console for cloud
                delivery.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to business intelligence (BI) and reporting, there are certain best
                practices that companies use for Microsoft Dynamics products that strive for an
                enterprise perspective, like sharing standardized reports across the business. Companies
                know they have all the data they need to enable their execs to make the best business
                decisions. But they often find themselves wondering whether they have all the software
                they need to access that data.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>As interest in mobile ECM grows, where do Microsoft Dynamics customers start
                    planning a strategy?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                With mobility gaining ground quickly in the workplace, the idea of putting corporate
                documents and proprietary materials on mobile devices for employees to use has become
                a priority for many companies. &quot;This is the new frontier in productivity: mobile
                access to enterprise content management (ECM) systems,&quot; writes Yorgen Edholm
                in <em>Get your enterprise content (safely) into the hands of your mobile workers<strong>.</strong></em></p>
            <p>
                &quot;Workers across all industries are pushing to use mobile devices in their professional
                roles, and companies and government agencies alike are trying to find ways to make
                this possible without losing control over the security of information,&quot; says
                Edholm. &quot;With a mobile ECM solution employees can securely access content when
                and where they need it.&quot;</p>

            </p>
            <p>
                On the 2nd of October 2013, CEM conducted an event on CEM Construct in Kuwait, at
                the Microsoft office. A real &ldquo;Construction Industry Day&rdquo; it was, with
                a gathering of veterans from the Construction Industry of Kuwait. CEM continued
                to excite its members with its distinct AX Construct, on how it effectively helps
                manage the complex Construction Projects, by lowering the costs, reducing project
                delays and by improving customer satisfaction. The attendees were totally enthusiastic
                at the distinct industry solutions built in Construct, who gave excellent feedback
                about the same. The event furthered with interactive sessions, followed by a networking
                lunch, which made the event a grand one. Have a glance at the photos from this event:<br />
