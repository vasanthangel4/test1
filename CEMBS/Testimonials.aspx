                    <i>UAE-based Bhatia Traders, part of the large &ldquo;House of ST Bhatia Group&rdquo;
                        are a diversified group involved in various activities ranging from trading to manufacturing
                        and service-centric operations.

                        <em>&ldquo;I want to take a moment and personally thank CEM Business Solutions for their
                            hard work and efforts for implementing Microsoft Dynamics GP &amp; RMS. We were
                            looking for suitable business management software to solve our multiple pain points
                            including conflict of data, the need to re-enter data in different applications,
                            delays in producing reports for the management information system and an application
                            that provides us a better inventory control system. </em>
                        <br />
                        <em>We partnered with Microsoft Gold Partner CEM Business Solutions and tasked the rollout
                            of the Dynamics Application to all the retail outlets, which took a speedy 90 days.
                            Along the way, the firm successfully re-engineered Bhatia Trader's business processes,
                            a process which took a further six months after the close of the implementation.</em><br />
                        <em>Post- implementation of Microsoft Dynamics GP &amp; RMS, we can see the increase
                            of our net profit from 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent. We needed a partner with proven
                            abilities to help us manage the implementation of Microsoft Dynamics GP, and we
                            knew we had found that partnership with CEM Business Solutions FZ LLC. &ldquo;</em>

                    <i>"We had contacted Microsoft to help us identify software that could support the growth
                        of our business, while still being cost effective. Because our company’s earlier
                        ERP system handled only a portion of Mourjan Marinas IGY business requiring employees
                        to manually enter data and rely on spread sheets to manage operations.
                        <br />
                        CEM Business Solutions, Gold certified partner of Microsoft provided us that solution
                        in the form of Microsoft Dynamics GP. We made the decision after an extensive research
                        to invest in the Microsoft platform because we liked the flexibility of the product,
                        the investment Microsoft makes in the solution that could support our business process
                        .With the help of CEM Support today we have got all our companies under Microsoft
                        Dynamics GP. Our investors are extremely happy with the timely reports and analysis
                        that GP can provide"</i>
